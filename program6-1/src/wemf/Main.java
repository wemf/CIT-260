     * 1) Tells the user what the program does.
     * 2) Prompts the user to an investment amount, for example, 1000.
     * 3) Gets the user's input and saves it. If the user's input is not a
     *    positive, non-zero value, display an error message, then loop back
     *    and prompt for a new value. Stay in this loop until you have a valid
     *    value.
     * 4) Prompts the user to enter an annual interest rate between 0 and 100.
     *    For example, 9 would be 9%.
     * 5) Gets the user's input and saves it. If the user's input is not positive
     *    or if it is greater than 100, display an error message, then loop back
     *    and prompt for a new value. Stay in this loop until you have a valid
     *    value.
     * 6) Using a method that you have written, calculate and display the future
     *    value of the investment for a period of 10 years.
     *    The formula for computing the future value of an investment is:
     *
     *    futureValue = investmentAmount x (1 + monthlyInterestRate)^(numberOfYears * 12)
